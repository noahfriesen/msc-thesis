\abstract{
It is well known that the braid group $\Bg$ of a simple Lie algebra $\g$ acts on integrable representations of $\g$ via products of exponentials of its Chevalley generators.
In particular, the Yangian $\Yhg$ is an integrable representation of $\g$, so there is an action of $\Bg$ on this space.
We show that modifying this action induces an action of $\Bg$ on a certain commutative subalgebra of $\Yhg$ by Hopf algebra automorphisms.
By dualizing this modified action, we recover an action of $\Bg$ on tuples of rational functions defined in the work of Y. Tan.
Using this dual action, we prove a conjecture of S. Gautam and C. Wendlandt that the two sufficient conditions for the tensor product of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of $\Yhg$ to be cyclic are identical.
One of these conditions involves the aforementioned action of $\Bg$ on rational functions, and the other involves roots of the Baxter polynomials, which have many interesting properties and ties to mathematical physics.
