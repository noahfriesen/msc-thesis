\chapter{Braid groups}

\section{Braid group action}

Here we review the action of the braid group of a simple Lie algebra on its integrable representations, and prove some important properties.

\section{Modified braid group action}

Here we define modified braid group operators that act on the Cartan part of the Yangian.

\section{Action on the universal \texorpdfstring{$R$}{R}-matrix}

Here we show how the braid group acts on the universal $R$-matrix and its $R^0$ part.
