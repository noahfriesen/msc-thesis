\chapter{Baxter polynomials and cyclicity}

A representation of $\Yhg$ is said to be \emph{cyclic} if it is generated by a single vector, i.e., if it is a highest-weight representation.
In this chapter, we prove a conjecture from \cite[\S 7.4]{gautam_poles_2023} which states that the two sufficient conditions for the cyclicity and irreducibility of any tensor product $L(\uP)\otimes L(\uQ)$ obtained in \cite{gautam_poles_2023} and \cite{tan_braid_2015} are identical.


\section{Baxter polynomials and poles}\label{sec:baxter-poles}

Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional highest-weight representation of $\Yhg$, and let $\lambda\in\h^*$ be the highest weight of $V$ as a representation of $\g$.
Recall the series $A_i(u)$ of Section \ref{ssec:alt-gen}; for each $i\in\I$ let $\lambda_i^A(u)\in 1+u^{-1}\C\db{u^{-1}}$ denote the eigenvalue of $A_i(u)$ on the highest weight space $V_\lambda$.
We then introduce the normalized operator
\[A_i^V(u) := \lambda_i^A(u)^{-1}A_i(u)\big|_V \in\End(V)\db{u^{-1}},\]
which acts by the identity on the highest weight space.
Then by \cite[Thm. 4.4]{gautam_poles_2023} (see also \cite[Cor. 4.7]{gautam_poles_2023} together with \cite[Prop. 5.7, 5.8]{hernandez_shifted_2022}), there is a unique monic polynomial $T_i(u)\in\End(V)[u]$ that satisfies
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:transfer-op}
    T_i(u+\hbar d_i) = A_i^V(u)T_i(u).
\end{equation}
We note that $T_i(u)$ can be recovered as $\lambda_i^T(u)^{-1}\mathscr{T}_i(u)$, where $\mathscr{T}_i(u)$ is the \emph{$i$th abelianized transfer operator} introduced in \cite[\S 4.3]{gautam_poles_2023} and $\lambda_i^T(u)$ is the eigenvalue of $\mathscr{T}_i(u)$ on the highest weight space; see \cite[Remark 5.1]{friesen_braid_2024} for details.
The eigenvalues of the operator $T_i(u)$ are called the \emph{(specialized) Baxter polynomials} associated to $V$.

The generating series $\xi_i(u)$ and $x^\pm_i(u)$ of $\Yhg$ introduced in Section \ref{ssec:Y-Hopf} operate on $V$ as the expansions at infinity of $\End(V)$-valued rational functions of $u$; see \cite[Prop. 3.6]{gautam_yangians_2016}.
We define the \emph{$i$th set of poles} of $V$ to be the joint set of poles of these operators:
\[\sigma_i(V) := \{\text{Poles of } \xi_i(u)\big|_V,\ x^\pm_i(u)\big|_V \in\End(V)(u)\} \subset\C.\]
The Baxter polynomials are related to the poles of $V$ in the following way: let $\zeros(P(u))$ denote the zeros of any polynomial $P(u)$, let $\mathcal{Z}_i(V)$ denote the zeros of all eigenvalues of $T_i(u)$, and let $\baxterV(u)$ denote the eigenvalue of $T_i(u)$ on the lowest weight space $V_{w_0(\lambda)}$ where $w_0\in\Wg$ is the longest element.
Then by \cite[Thm. 4.4]{gautam_poles_2023}, for all $i\in\I$ we have
\[\sigma_i(V) = \mathcal{Z}_i(V) = \zeros(\baxterV(u)).\]

In the case where $V$ is irreducible, the polynomials $\baxterV(u)$ (and hence the poles of $V$) were computed explicitly in \cite[Thm. 5.2]{gautam_poles_2023}: for all $i\in\I$,
\[\baxterV(u) = \prod_{j\in\I}\prod_{b=d_i}^{2\kappa-d_i} P_j\left(u-(b-d_j)\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)^{v_{ij}^{(b)}}\]
where $\uP=(P_j(u))_{j\in\I}$ is the tuple of Drinfeld polynomials associated to $V\cong L(\uP)$, $\kappa$ is $1/4$ times the eigenvalue of the Casimir element $C\in\Ug$ on the adjoint representation of $\g$ as in Example \ref{E:dual-braid-sl3}, and the integers $v_{ij}^{(b)}$ are obtained from the \emph{quantum Cartan matrix} $(v_{ij}(z))_{i,j\in\I}$; see \cite[\S 5.2]{friesen_braid_2024} for details.


\section{Baxter polynomials associated to extremal weights}

Now let $V$ be irreducible, so $V=L(\uP)$ for some Drinfeld polynomials $\uP=(P_i(u))_{i\in\I}$, and the highest weight of $V$ as a representation of $\g$ is $\lambda = \sum_{i\in\I}\deg(P_i)\omega_i$.
For any $w\in\Wg$, let $\baxterP(u)\in\C[u]$ denote the eigenvalue of $T_i(u)$ on the extremal weight space $V_{w(\lambda)}$.
In particular, if $w$ is the longest element $w_0$, then $\baxterP(u) = \baxterV(u)$.

The following theorem is the main result of this chapter.
It gives a factorization of the Baxter polynomial $\baxterP(u)$ in terms of the braid group action defined in the previous chapter on the Drinfeld polynomials.

\begin{theorem}\label{T:baxter}
    Let $w = s_{j_1}s_{j_2}\cdots s_{j_p}$ be a reduced expression for $w\in\Wg$.
    For each $1\leq r\leq p$, set $w_r := s_{j_{r+1}}\cdots s_{j_p}$, where $w_p = {\id}$.
    Then
    \[\baxterP(u) = \prod_{r:j_r=i} \braid_{w_r}(\uP)_i.\]
    Moreover, $\braid_{w_r}(\uP)_{j_r}$ is a monic polynomial in $u$ for each $r$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    First, since $s_{j_p}\cdots s_{j_{r+1}}s_{j_r}$ is a reduced expression, it follows that $w_r^{-1}(\alpha_{j_r}) = s_{j_p}\cdots s_{j_{r+1}}(\alpha_{j_r}) \in\Phi^+$.
    Then by Corollary \ref{C:Tan-monic}, $\braid_{w_r}(\uP)_{j_r}$ is a monic polynomial in $u$ for each $r$.

    By the defining equation \ref{eqn:transfer-op} of $T_i(u)$, the eigenvalue of the normalized operator $A_i^V(u) = \lambda_i^A(u)^{-1}A_i(u)$ on the extremal weight space $V_{w(\lambda)}$ is given by
    \[\frac{\baxterP(u+\hbar d_i)}{\baxterP(u)}\]
    hence the eigenvalue of $A_i(u)$ on $V_{w(\lambda)}$ is $\lambda_i^A(u)$ times the above.
    On the other hand, by Proposition \ref{P:extremal-weight} the eigenvalue of $A_i(u)$ on $V_{w(\lambda)}$ is $\braid_w(\ul)(A_i(u))$, where $\ul$ is the highest weight of $V$.
    Then by the uniqueness assertion of Lemma \ref{L:diff-eqn}, it suffices to prove that
    \[\braid_w(\ul)(A_i(u))
    = \lambda_i^A(u)\prod_{r:j_r=i}\braid_{w_r}(\ul)_i
    = \lambda_i^A(u)\prod_{r:j_r=i}\frac{\q^{2d_i}\braid_{w_r}(\uP)_i}{\braid_{w_r}(\uP)_i},\]
    where the second equality follows from the fact that the action of $\braid_{w_r}$ is an automorphism and $\ul = (\q^{2D}\uP)\uP^{-1}$.
    Using the definition of the dual braid group action from the beginning of the previous chapter, the first equality is equivalent to
    \[\mbraid_{w^{-1}}(A_i(u)) = A_i(u)\prod_{r:j_r=i}\mbraid_{w_r^{-1}}(\xi_i(u)).\]
    To prove this, we will use induction on the length $p$ of $w$: if $p = 1$ then this equation reduces to the identity $\mbraid_j(A_i(u)) = A_i(u)\xi_i(u)^{\delta_{ij}}$ that we established in Proposition \ref{P:tau-a}.
    Now suppose that this equation holds for $w$ of length $p$, and consider the element $w' = ws_{j_{p+1}}$ of length $p+1$.
    Then again using the identity of Proposition \ref{P:tau-a}, we have
    \begin{align*}
        \mbraid_{(w')^{-1}}(A_i(u)) &= \mbraid_{j_{p+1}}(\mbraid_w(A_i(u))) \\
        &= A_i(u)\xi_i(u)^{\delta_{i,j_{p+1}}}\prod_{\substack{1\leq r\leq p \\ j_r=i}}\mbraid_{j_{p+1}}(\mbraid_{w_r^{-1}}(\xi_i(u))) \\
        &= A_i(u)\xi_i(u)^{\delta_{i,j_{p+1}}}\prod_{\substack{1\leq r\leq p \\ j_r=i}}\mbraid_{(w'_r)^{-1}}(\xi_i(u)) \\
        &= A_i(u)\prod_{\substack{1\leq r\leq p+1 \\ j_r=i}}\mbraid_{(w'_r)^{-1}}(\xi_i(u))
    \end{align*}
    which completes the proof.
\end{proof}


\section{Cyclicity criteria for tensor products}

An important property of the poles of representations of $\Yhg$ is that they encode information about when the tensor product of two irreducible representations is cyclic or irreducible.
By \cite[Thm. 7.2]{gautam_poles_2023}, the representation $L(\uP)\otimes L(\uQ)$ is cyclic if for all $i\in\I$, none of the zeros of $Q_i(u+\hbar d_i)$ are poles of $L(\uP)$, i.e., if
\[\zeros(Q_i(u+\hbar d_i)) \subset \C\setminus\sigma_i(L(\uP)).\]
By \cite[Cor. 7.3]{gautam_poles_2023}, $L(\uP)\otimes L(\uQ)$ is irreducible if in addition to the above condition, none of the zeros of $P_i(u+\hbar d_i)$ are poles of $L(\uQ)$:
\[\zeros(P_i(u+\hbar d_i)) \subset \C\setminus\sigma_i(L(\uQ)).\]

Another sufficient condition for the cyclicity of a tensor product of irreducible representations was given in \cite[Thm. 4.8]{tan_braid_2015} using the action of the braid group on $(\C(u)^\times)^\I$, following \cite{chari_braid_2002}.
Let $w_0 = s_{j_1}s_{j_2}\cdots s_{j_p}$ be a reduced expression for the longest element $w_0\in\Wg$, and set $w_r := s_{j_{r+1}}\cdots s_{j_p}$ for each $1\leq r\leq p$ as in the previous section.
Then by \cite[Thm. 4.8]{tan_braid_2015} and the results of Section \ref{sec:extending}, $L(\uP)\otimes L(\uQ)$ is cyclic if for all $1\leq r\leq p$, the polynomials $Q_{j_r}(u+\hbar d_{j_r})$ and $\braid_{w_r}(\uP)_{j_r}$ have no roots in common:
\[\zeros(Q_{j_r}(u+\hbar d_{j_r})) \subset \C\setminus\zeros(\braid_{w_r}(\uP)_{j_r}).\]

It was conjectured in \cite[\S 7.5]{gautam_poles_2023} that the two sufficient conditions for cyclicity above are identical.
To prove this, recall from Section \ref{sec:baxter-poles} that the poles of a finite-dimensional highest-weight representation are exactly the zeros of the Baxter polynomial associated to the lowest weight.
Then using the factorization given in Theorem \ref{T:baxter}, we obtain the following corollary.

\begin{corollary}\label{C:baxter-poles}
    Let $\uP$ be a tuple of Drinfeld polynomials.
    For all $i\in\I$, the $i$th set of poles of $L(\uP)$ is given by
    \[\sigma_i(L(\uP)) = \bigcup_{r:j_r=i}\zeros(\braid_{w_r}(\uP)_i).\]
\end{corollary}

Combining this corollary with the cyclicity criteria of \cite{gautam_poles_2023} and \cite{tan_braid_2015} above, we see that they are identical.
The following corollary summarizes this result.

\begin{corollary}\label{C:cyclicity}
    Let $\uP = (P_i(u))_{i\in\I}$ and $\uQ = (Q_i(u))_{i\in\I}$ be tuples of Drinfeld polynomials.
    The following conditions are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For all $i\in\I$, $\zeros(Q_i(u+\hbar d_i))\subset\C\setminus\sigma_i(L(\uP))$.
        \item For all $1\leq r\leq p$, $\zeros(Q_{j_r}(u+\hbar d_{j_r}))\subset\C\setminus\zeros(\braid_{w_r}(\uP)_{j_r})$.
    \end{enumerate}
    If either of these conditions hold, then the representation $L(\uP)\otimes L(\uQ)$ is cyclic.
\end{corollary}
