\chapter{Yangians}

\section{Simple Lie algebras}

We review the structure of a simple Lie algebra, and the classification of its irreducible representations by dominant integral weights.


\section{Yangians}

\subsection{Structure}

We give the generators and relations of the Yangian associated to a simple Lie algebra.

\subsection{Representation theory}

We review the classification of the irreducible representations of the Yangian by Drinfeld polynomials.
